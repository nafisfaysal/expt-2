Performance Report & Action Plan
Benchmark Results (10,000 Addresses)
Total Addresses Processed: 10,000
Time Taken: 3 minutes, 4 seconds (184 seconds)
Final Processing Rate: Approximately 54 addresses per second
This is an excellent result and our best performance yet. The more detailed prompt did not significantly slow down the gpt-4o model, and our batching strategy is working efficiently.
Projection for 1.5 Million Addresses
Based on our definitive benchmark, here is the realistic projection for your full dataset:
Total Addresses: 1,500,000
Rate: 54 addresses/second
Calculation:
Total Seconds: 1,500,000 / 54 = ~27,778 seconds
Total Minutes: 27,778 / 60 = ~463 minutes
Total Hours: 463 / 60 = ~7.7 hours
Conclusion: With this script running on a single machine, you can process the entire 1.5 million addresses in approximately 7.7 hours.


Of course. Here is the simple, direct plan.

### **Simple Plan: Process 1.5 Million Addresses in Under 1 Hour**

To get this done in about **30 minutes**, we need to run our script on **16 servers** at the same time.

Here's exactly what to do:

**Step 1: Split Your Big File**

1.  Put your file with 1.5 million addresses (let's call it `all_addresses.csv`) into the project folder.
2.  Run this command in your terminal to split it into 16 smaller files:
    ```bash
    python split_csv.py all_addresses.csv 16
    ```
3.  You will now have a new folder named `split_data` containing `part_1.csv`, `part_2.csv`, all the way to `part_16.csv`.

**Step 2: Process the Files in Parallel**

1.  Set up **16 servers**.
2.  On **each server**, place a copy of the `main.py` script.
3.  Give each server one of the split files. For example:
    *   Server 1 gets `part_1.csv`
    *   Server 2 gets `part_2.csv`
    *   ...and so on.
4.  On **all 16 servers at the same time**, run the following command, changing the file numbers for each server:

    *   **On Server 1:**
        ```bash
        python main.py part_1.csv results_1.csv --concurrency 200 --batch-size 100
        ```
    *   **On Server 2:**
        ```bash
        python main.py part_2.csv results_2.csv --concurrency 200 --batch-size 100
        ```
    *   *(...do this for all 16 servers)*

**Step 3: Combine The Results**

After about 30 minutes, all servers will be finished. Each one will have a `results_x.csv` file.

1.  Copy all 16 `results_x.csv` files from the servers back to your main computer.
2.  Combine them into one final CSV file.

That's it. This plan will get the entire job done in well under an hour.
