Performance Report & Action Plan
Benchmark Results (10,000 Addresses)
Total Addresses Processed: 10,000
Time Taken: 3 minutes, 4 seconds (184 seconds)
Final Processing Rate: Approximately 54 addresses per second
This is an excellent result and our best performance yet. The more detailed prompt did not significantly slow down the gpt-4o model, and our batching strategy is working efficiently.
Projection for 1.5 Million Addresses
Based on our definitive benchmark, here is the realistic projection for your full dataset:
Total Addresses: 1,500,000
Rate: 54 addresses/second
Calculation:
Total Seconds: 1,500,000 / 54 = ~27,778 seconds
Total Minutes: 27,778 / 60 = ~463 minutes
Total Hours: 463 / 60 = ~7.7 hours
Conclusion: With this script running on a single machine, you can process the entire 1.5 million addresses in approximately 7.7 hours.
